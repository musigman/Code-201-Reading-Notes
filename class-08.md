## CSS Layout
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in it's own box; either on a **block level** or on an **inline** level. Block level boxes start on a new line and act as a main building block. A **header tag** is a block level element.
**Inline level boxes** flow between surrounding text. An **image tag** is an example of this.

## Positioning of Elements
CSS allows you to position elements on the page. **Normal Flow** means every block level element appears on a new line. **Relative Positioning** moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow. **Absolute Positioning** positions the element in relation to it's containing element.

**Fixed Positioning** 
means the element is fixed and does not move when the browser is scrolled.

## Floating Elements
Floating elements allow you to move left or right and allow other elements to flow around it.

## Z-index
This allows to you overlap elements on top of each other. I've found this helpful when I want to positioning a graphic a certain way so it doesn't interfere with the positioning of other elements.

## Float
I want to write about the float property because I've spent lots of time using it over the years playing around with it. Float  will allow you to place boxes next to each other on the same line. Float: left, Float: right, Float: both, or Float: none are all options. 

## Multi Column layouts
Many web pages use multiple column design layout. This is acheived by styling **DIV or Section** elements to use float left or right.

## Static and Liquid layouts
A static page means that when a browser is sized, the content of the page does not move. By sizing the page you will see smaller sizes of the page. A Liquid layout changes and adapts to the size of the browser when adjusted.
