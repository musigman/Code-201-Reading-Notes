# Read: 02 - HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instruction
## Text
When creating a web page, you add tags known as markups to the content of the page. Tags provide meaning and allow browsers to show appropriate structure for the page.

## Structural Markup
Are elements used to describe headings and paragraphs. Structural tags include:
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Bold
- Italic
- Line breaks
- Horizontal lines

## Semantic Markup
Helps other programs to read the webpage. An example would be a screen reader for the visually impaired.
Semantic tags include:
- Strong
- Emphasis
- Quotations
- Citations

# Introducing CSS

While HTML creates the structure of a web page, CSS gives designers **unlimited color, font and layout options.** 

A key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine there is an invisible box around every HTML object. And CSS creates rules that control the way that each box and box contents are presented.

Box examples include:
- Width and Height
- Borders
- Background colors

Text examples include:
- Typefaces
- Size
- Color

## CSS Rules
A CSS rule contains two parts: **A selector** and a **declaration**.

The selector indicates which element to be styled and the rule applies to. A declaration indicates how the element should be styled.

Declarations have 2 parts: a property and a value.

A *.css file* is a separate styling sheet that is linked from HTML code so the styles are recognized. While .css styles can be included in an HTML file using style tags, having a separate style sheet gives other pages of the web site consistent styling. 

## Color usage options
- Background
- foreground
- text
- outlines
- solid and opaque colors



**CSS 3** is the most current version and handles a variety of color formats including: *RGB, Hex Code, RGBA and HSLA.* The latter 2 options on this list are my favorite because it gives the designer opacity options.

# Basic Javascript instructions
Each individual series of instuctions in Javascript is known as a statement. Each one starts on a new line.

Comments are used to help the developer by adding short descriptions of what the code is doing.
 ## Variables
 A variable is a line of code that holds data. It is made up of 'var' plus the 'variable name'. Once you have created a variable it must have a value assigned to it.

 ### Variable Data Types
- Numeric Data: Numbers
- String Data: Letters
- Boolean: True/False Statements

**Oh, this is good to remember!**
Rules for naming a variable:
- Must begin with a letter or $, an underscore and must not start with a number.
- No dashes or periods
- No keywords or reserved words
- Variables are case sensitive
- Use a name that means something

## Arrays
An array is a variable and stores a list of values. Values in an array is given a number called an index. Index values start with 0, which is actually counted as 1. 
Each array has a property called length, which holds the number of items.

## Expressions
Expressions add value to a variable. An example: **var color = 'blue';** Here's another: **var area = 3 * 2;**

## Operators
But wait, there's more...
Expressions rely on operators. No, not like bus drivers; they create single value from one or more values. You can have arithmetic or string operators. String meaning non numbers however an expression can combine an arithmatic and string operator.
