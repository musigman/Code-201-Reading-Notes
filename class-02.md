# Reading Day: 02 
HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instruction

Today I learned about the two main types of HTML tags. They include **Structural Markup tags** and **Semantic Markup tags**. Structural markups are elements used to describe headings and paragraphs. Structural tags include:

- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Bold
- Italic
- Line breaks
- Horizontal lines

Semantic Markups are more specific and have uses that help other technologies including screen readers for the visually impaired. Semantic tags include:
- Strong
- Emphasis
- Quotations
- Citations

# Introducing CSS
While HTML creates the structure of a web page, CSS gives designers **unlimited color, font and layout options.** 

Text styling control examples include:
- Typefaces
- Size
- Color

We can style areas with CSS. A good way to understant how CSS works is to imagine there is an invisible box around every HTML object. And CSS creates rules that control the way that each box and box contents are presented. Box examples include:
- Width and Height
- Borders
- Background colors

## CSS Rules
A CSS rule contains two parts: **A selector** and a **declaration**. The selector indicates which element to be styled and the rule applies to. A declaration indicates how the element should be styled. Declarations have 2 parts: a property and a value.

A best practice of web design says that CSS files should be seperate from the HTML file and is linked from HTML code so the styles are recognized by the HTML document. While .css styles can be included in an HTML file using style tags, having a separate style sheet gives other pages of the web site consistent styling. 

**CSS 3** is the most current version and handles a variety of color formats including: **RGB, Hex Code, RGBA and HSLA.** The latter 2 options on this list are my favorite because it gives the designer opacity options.

# Basic Javascript instructions
Each individual series of instructions in Javascript is known as a **statement**. Each statement begins on a new line. 

 A **variable** is a line of code that holds data. It is made up of 'var' plus the 'variable name'. Once you have created a variable it must have a value assigned to it. There are 3 types of variable data that include: 
- Numeric Data: Numbers
- String Data: Letters
- Boolean: True/False Statements

**Oh, this is important to remember!** 
Rules for naming a variable:
- Must begin with a letter or $, an underscore and must not start with a number.
- No dashes or periods
- No keywords or reserved words
- Variables are case sensitive
- Use a name that means something
Using a name that associates with the variable will be helpful in writing the code.

## Arrays
An array is a variable and stores a list of values. Values in an array is given a number called an index. Index values start with 0, which is actually counted as 1. Each array has a property called length, which holds the number of items.

## Expressions
Expressions add value to a variable. An example: **var color = 'blue';** Here's another: **var area = 3 * 2;**

## Operators
But wait, there's more...
Expressions rely on operators. No, not like bus drivers; they create single value from one or more values. You can have arithmetic or string operators. String meaning non numbers however an expression can combine a number and string operator.

Learning about Javascript is exciting and challenging. The biggest challenges of this language are applying the concepts to the syntax (code). Over the past few weeks I’ve had some ‘aha’ moments as if I were putting together a puzzle and the right piece fit. I’m getting there.
