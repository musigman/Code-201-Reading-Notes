# The Quest to Build the Perfect Team
Julia Rozovsky tells her stories of working together in group settings. The first setting was a study group that was stressful due to competitive dynamics of the team members. She talks about the feeling of having to 'prove herself' in a critical environment. 

A second group she talks about is one where ideas were accepted and the environment was social and fun.

# Study of Effeciency
The Harvard Business Review reported that 'the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more'. 3/4 of an employee's day is spent communicating with colleagues.

Softwared engineers are encouraged to work together. Studies have found that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and have higher job satisfaction.

 My experiece at Code Fellows has opened my eyes to workig with a group. I've found that I enjoy working within a peer group and have found it to be a motivating factor in producing great work.

 ## Google Studies
 Google spent millions of dollars to research building the perfect team, a research project called **'Project Aristotle'**. The research team studyed nearly all aspects of employees' lives. The study followed social patterns and interests, and factors that seemed to have an impact on a team's success.

 ## Group Norms
 As Google studied to figure out team success, Rozovsky and her collegues came across research about **'Group Norms**. Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.

 ## Successful Teams
 The researchers noticed two behaviors that all good teams generally shared. The first behaviors was sharing the same proportion, meaning that each person spoke about the same amount. This is known as **'Equality in Distribution'**

 The sectond good teams had high **'Average Social Sensitivity'**. This means they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on tone of voice and non-verbal cues.

 Ultimately the research from Aristotle has encouraged teams to come together by adopting a data-driven approach which includes creating a'Psychologically Safe' team work environment.
