## HTML & CSS
 The **Transform** property allows you to animate (2D and 3D) objects and allows you to adjust the style. You can scale, rotate and skew elements to change the object's perspective. Although you can apply transitions to raster based objects (.jpg, .gif, .png) this article talks about using vector based/SVG graphics. 

 ## Transitions & Animations
 CSS allows you to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Animations within CSS3 allow the apprearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. For a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state. It's helpful to think of a timeline and points (keyframes) along that timeline cue a specific transition state.

 ## Transition Duration
 The duration in which a transition takes place is set up using the transition-duration property. The **transition-timing-function** property is used to set the speed in which a transition witll move. **Transition Delay** will set up a time value and determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing. I liked the 'card flip' demo in the article. I'd like to use it in a project.
