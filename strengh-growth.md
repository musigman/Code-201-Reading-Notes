Top Strengths and Areas for Growth

For years I've worked as a Marketing coordinator/Graphic Designer/Web Designer/Jack of all trades. The ladder is somewhat a double edged sword as there were areas I could be much better at.
In these roles I've worked with smaller marketing departments I've gained skills with managing projects. I consider this to be one of my strengths.

When it comes to a project beginning I approach it with expectations: Knowing project goals, who I'll be working with, the stakeholders involved, and timelines and deadlines. This allows me to plan and prioritize my duties and complete the project.

Creative proficiency is also one of my strengths. Coming from a visual design background the creative process is something I'm familiar with and gives me satisfaction to problem solve to acheive the solution.

As I consider growth mindset and approaching Code 201 and beyond I think about areas of growth being adaptability proficiency, handling ambiguity, and root cause resolution proficiency.

I had many 'A-ha' moments throughout Code 102 that caused me to think about how I have historically handled problem solving. Knowing how I responded in frustration when a solution to a problem required patience, adaptability, and letting go of the way I thought the solution should be was enlightening. 

Using this information also helped in moments that I just needed to take a (reset) break to clear my head and come back with a clear mindset to work on a project. 

Root cause resolution is sometimes a challenge especially if I think the solution should be quick and easy. Sometimes I've glossed over this part of the process because I'm more concerned with reaching a deadline.

I'm looking for an easy solutionI'm glad to be in a learning mindset with newly aquired skills that I'll be putting into place.
