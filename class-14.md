# The Quest to Build the Perfect Team
Julia Rozovsky tells her stories of working together in group settings. The first setting was a study group that was stressful due to competitive dynamics of the team members. She talks about the feeling of having to 'prove herself' in a critical environment. 

A second group she talks about is one where ideas were accepted and the environment was social and fun.

# Study of Effeciency
The Harvard Business Review reported that 'the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more'. 3/4 of an employee's day is spent communicating with colleagues.

Softwared engineers are encouraged to work together. Studies have found that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and have higher job satisfaction.

 My experiece at Code Fellows has opened my eyes to workig with a group. I've found that I enjoy working within a peer group and have found it to be a motivating factor in producing great work.

 ## Google Studies
 Google spent millions of dollars to research building the perfect team, a research project called **'Project Aristotle'**. The research team studyed nearly all aspects of employees' lives. The study followed social patterns and interests, and factors that seemed to have an impact on a team's success.

 ## Group Norms
 As Google studied to figure out team success, Rozovsky and her collegues came across research about **'Group Norms**. Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.

 ## Successful Teams
 The researchers noticed two behaviors that all good teams generally shared. The first behaviors was sharing the same proportion, meaning that each person spoke about the same amount. This is known as **'Equality in Distribution'**

 The sectond good teams had high **'Average Social Sensitivity'**. This means they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on tone of voice and non-verbal cues.

 Ultimately the research from Aristotle has encouraged teams to come together by adopting a data-driven approach which includes creating a'Psychologically Safe' team work environment.

 ## HTML & CSS
 The **Transform** property allows you to animate (2D and 3D) objects and allows you to adjust the style. You can scale, rotate and skew elements to change the object's perspective. Although you can apply transitions to raster based objects (.jpg, .gif, .png) this article talks about using vector based/SVG graphics. 

 ## Transitions & Animations
 CSS allows you to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Animations within CSS3 allow the apprearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. For a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state. It's helpful to think of a timeline and points (keyframes) along that timeline cue a specific transition state.

 ## Transition Duration
 The duration in which a transition takes place is set up using the transition-duration property. The **transition-timing-function** property is used to set the speed in which a transition witll move. **Transition Delay** will set up a time value and determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing. I liked the 'card flip' demo in the article. I'd like to use it in a project.

 ## 8 Simple CSS3 Transitions that will Wow Users
 These transitions include:
 - Fade In
 - Change Color
 - Grow and Shrink
 - Rotate
 - Square to Circle
 - 3D Shadow
 - Swing 
 - Inset Border

 ## Buttons and Animation
 Okay, I'm liking this. Seeing these buttons and different ways to animate are giving me ideas and inspiration for my final project!
