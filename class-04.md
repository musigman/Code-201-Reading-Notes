# Reading Day: 04

## Links
Links are the gateway to the internet. With links we are able to move to navigate the web. They can lead us to information on the same page we are reading, take us to different pages on a website, or explore other websites altogether. Links are created using an "a" tag.


## Directory Structures
Code is placed in folders called directories that house our web files. The structures keep things organized and is helpful in creating navigation throughout a website. 

## URL
URL stands for Uniform Remote Locator and every webpage has a 'URL' address so it can be accessed. There are several types of links. Relative links connect to a page and might have a directory structure like: images/funnypic.jpg, or css/style.css. An absolute link would have the full URL (example: http://www.kethmusig.com).

## Screen Sizes and layouts
There are different types of page designs that were mentioned in the reading. Fixed width layouts are typically measured in pixel sizes. Fixed means that the size doesn't change. Liquid layouts on the other hand are measured in percentages. What this means is that elements on the page will size as the user adjusts the size of the browser.

## JS Functions
A Function **functionHeader () {** declaration  uses a related name,parameters, and an invoking statement.
Functions are encapsulated and do nothing until they are called or invoked to perform a task: **inVokeStatement();**

## Pair Programming
This is resonating with me because of what I've experienced so far at Code Fellows.
Pair programming fosters collaboration to learn key industry skills.

I've experienced parts of this process so far and has helped me understand complex concepts through working with a TA.
**The 6 reasons for Pair Programming include:**
1. Greater Efficiency
1. Engaged Collaboration
1. Learning from other Students
1. Social Skills
1. Job Interview Readiness
1. Work Environment Readiness

Today was the first day of Pair Programming in a class lab. I can say that I gained from the experience and can see that it will be a strong factor in learning and interacting.
