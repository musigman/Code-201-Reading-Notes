# Reading Day: 03
## Boxes
An HTML 5 page layout is laid out in boxes. Box areas have specific tag titles but the generic tag is called a **div element**.
With CSS, we have a more advanced way for styling divs on the page. We can style box sizes, colors and organize our content in more visually interesting ways than earlier versions of HTML.

## Padding and Margins
These allow us to adjust space. **Margins** allow us to add space between adjacent boxes or (divs) on the page. Padding adjusts the spacing of the content inside the box to the edge of the box.

Boxes can be styled with ulimited color choices. When first creating divs on a page it is helpful to create borders so you can see the basic layout that has been created. Borders can be styled to have rounded corners. Further styling include drop shadow options. CSS gives you a lot of control in adjusting colors, size and opacity.

## Java Script Arrays
So now I'm jumping into a Java Script topic I'm assimilating. **Arrays** An array is a variable and stores a list of values. Values in an array is given a number called an index. Index values start with 0, which is actually counted as 1. Each array has a property called length, which holds the number of items.

## If Else Statements
This statement checks a line of code block and asks if something is true. If a condition is false then a second line of code runs instead.

## Switch Statements
Switch statements have multiple variable lines of code triggered by the user response. Each switch statement gives a different message to the user depending on the answer.

## For and While Loops
**For Loops** happen when a develper only wants to give a user a limited amount of responses before the loop ends. I'm reminded of modern password protection where you only get a few attempts before you are not able to enter a password. **While Loops** on the other hand can loop indefinitely without stopping the cycle.

This last reading has me a bit loopy.
