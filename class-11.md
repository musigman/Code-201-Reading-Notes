# Images
You can control the size of images with CSS using width and height properties.  Using class names, you can controll the image sizes individually. Specifying image sizes helps pages load more smoothly.

Using the float property will allow you to align an image left or right: float: left; or float: right; .
To center an element it must be turned into a block level element because by default it is an inline element.
By using a display: block; attribute you may then use an align-center; or adjust the margins of an image.

The background image property allows you to place an image behind an HTML element. You may also choose to repeat the image horizontally using repeat-x; repeat the image vertically using repeat-y; or having a no repeat by using background-repeat: no-repeat; The image can also be fixed or scrolled: background-attachment: fixed;

Finding the background position property was like finding a really great deal on a pair of pants. I've struggled with image placement
before and knowing this property will definitly help. 

# Practical Information

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
SEO helps webcrawlers and search engines find your site and get them noticed in the results. There are many factors that effect page rankings that include: relevant page content and links to other sites. Relevant page content is enhanced by having a page title, proper headings, alt image tags updated with descriptions and meta data. Meta Data are keywords that describe the page content inside of **Meta tags** that are in the head section of a document. **Keywords** are important when you set up SEO. Keyword organization of topics, product offerings, relevant business information contribute to updating search information.

## Google Analytics
Google offers this free service that allows you see how many people are viewing your site, track your customer locations, what content they viewed on your website and for how long. This breakdown of information can tell you a lot about how your webpage is used and what needs to be reworked.

## Domain Names and Hosting
A domain name is the URL address of a web page. Every website has one and as long as noone else has the name you want, you can have a custom URL name that most commonly ends with: .html 

A hosting service is a company that houses a website on their servers and points to a domain. They make lots of money doing so!



# HTML 5 Video and Audio
I have an interest in audio and video html elements. Being a musician and designer I'm always interested
learning new and 'correct' ways to update content. This article talks about the **video** and **audio** elements of html.

The **HTML Media Element API**provides features to control video and audio players by giving you an interface to control
the media your watching or listening to. 
The API is created in HTML and styled in CSS. It gives you control in playing, pausing and stopping the video. The API also
gives control with rewind and fast forward too.
